# Installation

---

### Composer

```bash
composer require rtippin/messenger
```

### Install Command
- Installs the base messenger files, publishing the [`messenger.php`][link-config] configuration file and `MessengerServiceProvider`.
- This will also register the published service provider in your `app.php` configuration file inside the `providers` array.
- You will be asked to confirm running this command, as well as an option to run the migrations before completion.
  - If your `Provider|User` models you are registering in `Messenger` use UUIDs instead of auto-incrementing integers as their primary keys, add the `--uuids` flag when installing.
```bash
php artisan messenger:install
```
```bash
#If your providers use UUIDs
php artisan messenger:install --uuids
```

### Migrate
- If you opted to not migrate while using the `messenger:install` command above, be sure you run it yourself before using the messenger system.
```bash
php artisan migrate
````

### Follow the instructions below for setting up your providers

---

## Messenger Providers

- Providers are the model's from your application you register into `Messenger`.
- For most applications, you will only register your `User` model. 
  - If you had a `User` and a `Teacher` model, you can register both models with `Messenger`, allowing teachers to have their own inbox, and able to message users as a teacher.
- Your provider models will also use the internal [Messenger.php][link-messenger-model] model, which acts as a settings model, as well as allowing reverse searching. More on this below, after registering providers.

---

### Registering Providers

- Head over to your new `App\Providers\MessengerServiceProvider`
- Using the `Messenger` facade, add all provider models you want to register into `Messenger`. The default `App\Models\User` is already preset, you just need to un-comment it.

**Default:**

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use RTippin\Messenger\Facades\Messenger;

class MessengerServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Bootstrap services.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function boot()
    {
        Messenger::registerProviders([
            User::class,
        ]);
    }
}
```

### Implement the `MessengerProvider` interface for each provider registered

- Each provider you register must implement the [`MessengerProvider`][link-messenger-contract] interface. 
- You should use the included [`Messageable`][link-messageable] trait on your providers to satisfy the [`MessengerProvider`][link-messenger-contract] interface.
- Override the `getProviderSettings()` method on each provider model you register.
- The `alias` will be auto-generated if null or not set. When auto-generating, the lower-snake case of the model's name will be used.

***Example:***

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use RTippin\Messenger\Contracts\MessengerProvider;
use RTippin\Messenger\Traits\Messageable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements MessengerProvider
{
    use Messageable; //Default trait to satisfy MessengerProvider interface
    
    public static function getProviderSettings(): array
    {
        return [
            'alias' => 'user',
            'searchable' => true,
            'friendable' => true,
            'devices' => true,
            'default_avatar' => public_path('vendor/messenger/images/users.png'),
            'cant_message_first' => [],
            'cant_search' => [],
            'cant_friend' => [],
        ];
    }
}
```

---

### Searchable

- You must implement the `getProviderSearchableBuilder()` method on providers you want to be searchable. Included is a [`Search`][link-search] trait that works out of the box with the default laravel `User` model.
  - You must also ensure `searchable` in the providers `getProviderSettings()` method is true (default).
- If you have different columns used to search for your provider, you can skip using the included [`Search`][link-search] trait, and define the `public static getProviderSearchableBuilder()` method yourself.
  - The query builder will be passed, along with the original full string search term, and an array of the search term exploded via spaces and commas.

***Example:***

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use RTippin\Messenger\Contracts\MessengerProvider;
use RTippin\Messenger\Traits\Messageable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements MessengerProvider
{        
    public static function getProviderSearchableBuilder(Builder $query,
                                                        string $search,
                                                        array $searchItems)
    {
        $query->where(function (Builder $query) use ($searchItems) {
            foreach ($searchItems as $item) {
                $query->orWhere('first_name', 'LIKE', "%{$item}%")
                ->orWhere('last_name', 'LIKE', "%{$item}%");
            }
        })->orWhere('email', '=', $search);
    }
}
```

---

### Friendable

- Allows your provider to be friended / have friends.
- Set `friendable` in the providers `getProviderSettings()` method to true (default).

---

### Devices

- Devices are a helpful way for you to attach a listener onto the [PushNotificationEvent][link-push-event]. When any broadcast over a private channel occurs, we forward a stripped down list of all recipients/providers and their types/IDs, along with the original data broadcasted, and the event name.
  - To use this event, you must be using the `default` broadcast driver set by this package, `BroadcastBroker`, and have `push_notifications` enabled. How you use the data from the event to send push notifications (FCM, APN, etc.) is up to you!

---

### Provider Interactions `cant_message_first` `cant_search` `cant_friend`

- Provider interactions, defined in each providers `getProviderSettings()` method, give fine grain control over how they can interact with other providers, should you have multiple.
- For each interaction, list the provider classes you want to deny that action from the parent provider.

```php
public static function getProviderSettings(): array
{
    return [
        //.....
        'cant_message_first' => [],
        'cant_search' => [],
        'cant_friend' => [],
    ];
}
```

`cant_message_first` revokes permissions to initiate a private conversation with the given providers. This does not stop or alter private threads already created, nor does it impact group threads. Creating a new private thread is referred to as "messaging first".

***Example: A user may not start the conversation with a company, but a company may start the conversation with the user. Once the private thread is created, it is business as usual!***

```php
//User
public static function getProviderSettings(): array
{
    return [
        'cant_message_first' => [Company::class],
    ];
}

//Company
public static function getProviderSettings(): array
{
    return [
        'cant_message_first' => [],
    ];
}
```

`cant_search` Filters search results, omitting the listed providers.

***Example: A user may not search for companies, but a company can search for users.***

```php
//User
public static function getProviderSettings(): array
{
    return [
        'cant_search' => [Company::class],
    ];
}

//Company
public static function getProviderSettings(): array
{
    return [
        'cant_search' => [],
    ];
}
```

`cant_friend` Revokes permission to initiate a friend request with the listed providers. This permission only impacts when one provider sends another a friend request. Cancelling / Accepting / Denying a friend request, or your list of actual friends, is not impacted by this permission.

***Example: A user may not send a friend request to a company, but a company can send a friend request to a user.***

```php
//User
public static function getProviderSettings(): array
{
    return [
        'cant_friend' => [Company::class],
    ];
}

//Company
public static function getProviderSettings(): array
{
    return [
        'cant_friend' => [],
    ];
}
```

---

### Providers name

- To grab your providers name, the default method returns the `name` column from your model, stripping tags and making words uppercase. You may overwrite the way the name on your model is returned using the below method.

***Example: Combining two columns `first` and `last` for the name***

```php
public function getProviderName(): string
{
    return strip_tags(ucwords($this->first." ".$this->last));
}
```

---

### Providers avatar column

- When provider avatars are enabled, the default column used on each provider models table for the avatar is of type `string/nullable` named `picture`.
  - You may overwrite the column name on your provider model using the below method, should your column be named differently.

***Example:***

```php
public function getProviderAvatarColumn(): string
{
    return 'avatar';
}
```

- If your provider (Eg: `User`) does not have any "avatar/picture" column, or you wish to add a new custom one for use with messenger only, you may create a custom migration to add your new column (must be `nullable`).

***Example Migration and new avatar column override for `User`:***

```php
//Your migration
Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->string('messenger_avatar')->nullable();
});

//User model override
public function getProviderAvatarColumn(): string
{
    return 'messenger_avatar';
}
```

---

### Providers last active column

- When online status is enabled, the default column used on each provider models table is of type `timestamp` named `updated_at`. 
- This is used to show when a provider was last active, and will be updated to the current timestamp when you use the messenger status heartbeat.
  - You may overwrite the column name on your provider model using the below method, should your column be named differently.

***Example:***

```php
    public function getProviderLastActiveColumn(): string
    {
        return 'last_active';
    }
```

---

## Messenger Model
- The [Messenger.php][link-messenger-model] model allows your providers to have individual "settings", such as online status and notification sound toggles.
- A `whereHasMorph` query will be used through the `messengers` table, enabling your providers search for others through the API.
- By default, the `Messenger` model will be created if it does not exist for a provider when accessing the `messenger/heartbeat` or `messenger/settings` API.
- To ensure your providers are kept in sync, it is best that you attach the messenger model yourself anytime one of your providers is created.

---

### Attaching the model to your existing records
- If you are installing `Messenger` into an application with existing providers/users, you can use the command below to attach the [Messenger.php][link-messenger-model] model to all existing records for each of the providers you registered above.

```bash
php artisan messenger:attach:messengers
```

#### See the [Command's][link-commands-docs] documentation for more information.

---

### Attaching the model on creation
- When one of your registered providers is created, such as a new `User`, you should attach the [Messenger.php][link-messenger-model] model using one of the methods below:

#### Using the getter on the facade, we perform a `firstOrCreate` for the messenger model
***Example using a User model***
```php
use App\Models\User;
use RTippin\Messenger\Facades\Messenger;

$user = User::create([
    'email' => 'new@example.org'
]);

Messenger::getProviderMessenger($user);
```

#### Using the factory to generate the model directly
***Example using a User model***
```php
use App\Models\User;
use RTippin\Messenger\Models\Messenger;

$user = User::create([
    'email' => 'new@example.org'
]);

Messenger::factory()->owner($user)->create();
```

#### For your model factories, you can implement the `afterCreating` hook in the `configure` method to attach the messenger model
***Example using a User model factory***
```php
<?php

namespace Database\Factories;

use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\Factory;
use RTippin\Messenger\Models\Messenger;

class UserFactory extends Factory
{
    protected $model = User::class;

    public function definition(): array
    {
        return [
            'name' => $this->faker->name,
            'email' => $this->faker->unique()->safeEmail,
            'demo' => true,
            'admin' => false,
            'password' => 'password',
        ];
    }

    public function configure(): self
    {
        return $this->afterCreating(function (User $user) {
            Messenger::factory()->owner($user)->create();
        });
    }
}
