- Underlying calling system you can extend. See the [Calling][link-calling] documentation.
- Group thread invitation links (like discord).
- All endpoints are protected behind policies.
- Scheduled commands for automated cleanup and checks.
- Queued jobs fired from our event subscribers.
- Most features can be toggled at runtime using our `Messenger` facade.
- `MessengerComposer` facade allows you to have easy access to the core actions anywhere within your own app, such as sending messages, images, reactions, and more.
- You can implement or extend your own `BroadcastDriver`, `VideoDriver`, and `FriendDriver`, simply by binding your classes into the container.
- Support for morph maps on your provider models. See: [Morph Maps][link-morph-maps]
- Optional extra payload when sending messages to allow custom json to be stored with the message.
- Owner relationships returns a `Ghost Profile` when not found (null-object pattern).
- Private threads auto-lock when the recipient is not found / deleted.

### Upcoming for v2

- Temporary Ephemeral conversations.
- Improved API pagination / filters.
- Condense attachment routes.
- Possible extraction of friends system.
- Improved image manipulation / saving of multiple sizes.
- Encryption of messages (E2E is the long term goal).
- Translations for internal messages.
- Pinned messages.
- Chat-bots able to trigger off of an event.

### Notes

- This is a `Laravel` package and must be installed in a `laravel` application to run.
- Read through the [`messenger.php`][link-config] config file before migrating!
- This is a pure backend driven package providing an API to interact with, thus no web UI or websocket implementation will be setup for you.
- Calling is disabled by default. You are responsible for implementing your own media server or connecting to a 3rd party provider.
- Configure your laravel applications broadcast driver and set up your websocket implementation to utilize the real-time broadcast emitted.
